# React Authentication using Firebase Auth

Reactjs authentication using firebase auth (using the new v9 API). The benefit of using this new API is that the final bundle size is much smaller compared to the previous - which in turn makes your React site efficient and load much faster.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

_**Note**: Before running `npm start` do place the relevant environment variables in the `.env.local` file for firebase configuration._
